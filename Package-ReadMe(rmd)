# comparsionPlot
  
The users would be able to compare data from two different companies using comparisons from line graphs and from side by side tables. This visualization would help users to make decisions such as what the overall trends of different aspects of the company's finances are. This can help them to make decisions such as choosing which company you'd want to buy stocks from.
